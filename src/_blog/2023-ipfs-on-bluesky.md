We’re excited to share that [IPFS now has an official presence on Bluesky](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/ipfs.bsky.social), a new decentralized social network that recently spun out of Twitter. Powered by the in-development [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), Bluesky aims to be a Twitter-like social media client that provides the benefits of interoperation, account portability, and algorithmic choice. 

Up until now, IPFS has only had an official social media presence on Twitter. As the landscape of social media continues to change dramatically, we believe having a presence in more than just one place will be beneficial to the IPFS community, ecosystem, and brand.

We chose to start with Bluesky because it shares many of the same values and goals that the IPFS ecosystem has. Additionally, the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) actively utilizes [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) and [content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/how-ipfs-works/#subsystems-overview). The CEO of Bluesky, Jay Graber, even gave a talk at IPFS Camp 2022 about Bluesky that can be watched below:

It’s still very early days at Bluesky (and it’s still in private beta), but it has shown early promise in solving some of the critical problems the social web has been plagued with. If you’re on Bluesky and want to keep up with IPFS there, [then give the new profile a follow](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/ipfs.bsky.social)!
