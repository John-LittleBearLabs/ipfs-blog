Read on to catch up with what‚Äôs happened in the ecosystem over the last few weeks.

## **Recap: IPFS Thing 2023 üîÑ**

The IPFS implementers community recently gathered in Brussels, Belgium for the second year of [IPFS √æing](https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/), an annual gathering dedicated to advancing IPFS implementation. With 12 tracks and over 75 talks, demos, and sessions, the 5-day summit that occurred in April 2023 was a showcase of recent advances across IPFS, a forum for sharing needs from the protocol, and an opportunity to chart new directions for the future of IPFS.

## **Brand New on IPFS ‚ú®**

**[IPFS is now on Bluesky!](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-ipfs-on-bluesky/)**

* We‚Äôre excited to share that IPFS now has an official presence on [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/)!

**[Content Blocking for the IPFS stack is finally here!](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-content-blocking-for-the-ipfs-stack/)**

* Traditionally, content blocking within the IPFS ecosystem has been performed only at the IPFS gateway level and directly in Nginx, using something called the "Badbits denylist" ‚Äî but now it can be enabled in Kubo & other tools in the IPFS stack too!

**[IPFS Principles](https://specs.ipfs.tech/architecture/principles/)**
