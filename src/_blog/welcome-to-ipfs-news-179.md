![](../assets/2022-ipfs-gateways-1.png)

[Learn about IPFS gateways](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-06-09-practical-explainer-ipfs-gateways-1/) with this two-part series explaining how they work and how to use them. The first post in the series takes a look at the challenges with the popular client-server model, how IPFS approaches these challenges with peer-to-peer networking and content addressing, the relationship between IPFS and HTTP(S), and finally a brief introduction to IPFS HTTP gateways. Read it on the [IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-06-09-practical-explainer-ipfs-gateways-1/).
