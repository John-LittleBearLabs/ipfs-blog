## **Filebase: Building Web3 with Web3**

![](../assets/ipfs-2022-04-14-2.png)

Filebase is the worldâ€™s first object storage platform powered by decentralized storage networks, unifying multiple networks under a single S3-compatible API to make decentralized storage accessible and easy to use. Its proprietary edge-caching technology achieves industry-leading performance when writing and fetching data to and from Web3, making it a highly-secure, geo-redundant alternative to traditional cloud storage at a fraction of the costs. [Keep reading](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-04-14-filebase/) to learn more about its unique implementation of IPFS pinning services.
