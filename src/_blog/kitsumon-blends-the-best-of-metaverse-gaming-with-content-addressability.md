Welcome to [Kitsumon](https://kitsumon.com/), an NFT game about collecting, breeding, and caring for adorable Kitsu pets. From play to earn professions like farming, fishing, cooking, and an in-depth NFT breeding system, all the way to MOBA PvP modes and land acquisition, Kitsumon has everything and more!

Kitsumon aims to unite the best areas of gaming to give users a truly polished and exciting metaverse experience. The project plans to help bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming with its ever-increasing collaborations with gaming guilds, scholarship programs and education. It’s entering markets such as eSports and utilizing mechanisms such as play-to-earn and view-to-earn to bring blockchain gaming to another level. 

# The Story Behind Kitsumon

Kitsumon derived from the mindful concepts of its founders, interlacing its team’s love for gaming and the history of the industry. Pinches of Pokemon, Tamagotchi, and more have been stitched together to take the best elements of everything they know and turn it into a unique and powerful gaming experience.

After the successful launch of [GEN-0](https://marketplace.kitsumon.com/explore) Kitsu collection and its native token earlier this year, Kitsumon has continued developing in the background and delivering on its roadmap. Kitsu 3D models can now be seen on the recently live KitsuDex, as well as the sensational breeding mechanism involving Digital DNA powered by Chainlinks VRF.

# IPFS and Kitsumon

IPFS will provide Kitsumon NFTs with decentralized storage and will be used to host NFT game content such as the 3D Kitsu game characters. This will ensure that Kitsumon has no single point of failure like you would have in a centralized file system and will provide a reliable tamper-proof storage solution. The NFT game content will always be available as metadata will be stored on the IPFS network via content addressing.

An extra layer of protection comes from Kitsumon's use of [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/). This ensures that NFT files are pinned by multiple nodes on the IPFS network for extra peace of mind.

# What’s Next for Kitsumon

* Kitsumon recently launched its highly anticipated breeding mechanism on Polygon’s Mumbai testnet on June 14th.
* The development of its metaverse professions gameplay is well underway where players will be able to become masters in Farming, Mining, Crafting, Cooking, Fishing or Alchemy.
* They will also be able to acquire land in the Kitsumon metaverse. This will allow players to produce NFT game assets which can be used to level up characters or be sold to other players via the Kitsumon marketplace.

Overall game development continue to accelerate in anticipation for the MOBA launch towards the end of 2022.
