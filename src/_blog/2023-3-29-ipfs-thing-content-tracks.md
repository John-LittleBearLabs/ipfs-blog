## Announcing the Content Tracks for IPFS Thing 2023

The IPFS implementers community will be gathering together in Brussels, Belgium in just a few weeks to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge… all in the pursuit of advancing IPFS implementations.

Today we’re excited to finally share the final list of the content tracks so you can know what to expect! Each track will have a variety of talks and discussions from members of the community.

### Opening Keynotes

During this opening session, we'll hear an overview of the latest implementations, tools, and advancements across the world of IPFS, and celebrate the winners of the IPFS Impact Grants Round 2.

### Standards, Governance, and DWeb Policy

This track sits at the intersection of IPFS standards, governance, and dweb and regulation. What's the latest on the IPFS protocol and governance? What specific problems do we face regarding existing regulation? What new regulation or changes could be helpful? Are there interesting policy angles that we can surface, develop, and advocate for? How do we make the dweb a robust, sustainable commons?

### IPFS Deployments + Operators

From best practices to the mistakes made along the way, this track is a chance to highlight how members of the community are running IPFS nodes at scale. Let's share what's working well and what implementations can do to make things even better!

### Interplanetary Databases

There’s a new class of distributed database technologies building atop steady advances in IPLD & hash linked data structures in general. In this track we’ll gather those brave enough to take on CAP theorem in a decentralized context, share notes on what’s working, and hear presentations from teams pushing the envelope on what databases can do and where they can exist.

### Data Transfer

Come join the Protocol Thunderdome as we battle to determine the best way to move content addressed bytes! We'll review recent progress in data transfer, including work coming out of the Move The Bytes Working Group, and explore how we can make IPFS 10x faster at getting your stuff than Web2!

### Measuring IPFS

A data-driven approach to the design and operation of IPFS and libp2p through rigorous network measurements, performance evaluation, and recommendations for builders and operators.

### IPFS on the Web

The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and least tractable surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges to bringing IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content served through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser extensions. This track will have talks on: current and future browser implementations, approaches to managing and publishing IPFS content on the web, building apps that connect to the IPFS from within HTTP contexts, culminating in planning for group working sessions around on specific IPFS+Web challenges on day 4 & 5 of IPFS Thing.

### Identity: UCAN TOO

User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are the decentralized, user-controlled alternative to OAuth and they're becoming fundamental building blocks of the next-gen interplanetary stack. In this track, we'll share tools, protocols, and projects built with UCANs.

### Decentralized Device Networks

People talk about the Internet of Things, but when are we going to talk about the IPFSNet of Things? Embedded devices and their networks provide interesting opportunities to explore the capabilities of IPFS and muse on what IPFS even is. We’ll hear from folks on what they’re doing, what’s working, and ponder how far we can flex IPFS to fit these hard to reach places.

### Decentralized Compute & AI

We believe computing and AI can become more powerful and useful by embracing content addressing and a “merkle-native” way of doing things. In this track, we'll discuss various projects in this area, sharing R&D experiences, future directions, use cases, and benefits.

### Content Routing

Approaches and protocols to content routing in IPFS, what we've learned so far, and directions for the future. Join this track to explore herding CIDs, bringing content providers closer to the seekers of content, new advances across content routing systems, and a fresh look at the horizon of what's to come.

### HTTP Gateways

How do we deliver IPFS content to the masses? In this track, we'll dive into the magical and maddening topic of HTTP Gateways. Topics include the evolving semantics of /ipfs/cid, .car blocks and rendered flat files, and large-scale efforts to improve gateway architectures such as Project Saturn and Project Rhea.

### Roadmapping Next Steps out of the IPFS þing

A discussion / breakout-oriented workshop for defining and committing to next steps out of the week's conversations, which we can land and celebrate at upcoming IPFS events in Q3 / Q4 2023.
