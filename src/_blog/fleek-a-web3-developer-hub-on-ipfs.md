Fleek is a development platform that allows developers to host dapps, websites, or other frontends and power their storage and data needs using Web3 protocols. It acts as an orchestrator of services such as IPFS, Filecoin, and ENS to provide an alternative to the traditional Web 2.0 hosting and storage infrastructure dominated by AWS, DNS, and others.

Through Fleek’s low-code application, any user can host frontends and store data on IPFS and Filecoin’s decentralized storage protocols. In this way, the platform is rebuilding the web’s stack from the ground up to make it permissionless, trustless, and community-owned.

In only two years, Fleek has accumulated over 30,000 sites, 1 million monthly file uploads, and over 40,000 users. These are all being stored on IPFS and backed up to Filecoin monthly by the dApps and websites that choose the platform to host their frontends, metadata, and files.

### **IPFS Integration**

There are two ways in which Fleek’s implementation makes use of IPFS:

* First, Fleek integrates IPFS’ hosting and storage infrastructure to provide a way for developers to host and store information in a distributed way.
* Then, Fleek provides developers with CLI, SDK, and GUI interfaces for developers to programmatically interact with this storage infrastructure.

The end result is an abstraction layer: an easy way for developers to store, pin, retrieve, and optimize files on IPFS and integrate these features into their projects. With Fleek, developers can access the same Web 2.0 experience they know today for [deploying a site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XJZsQVu0Gk) and app through a [CI/CD pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcwYPG83DNw) or low-code application. The platform orchestrates the necessary IPFS infrastructure to make it possible in the background.

### **Filecoin Integration**

When it comes to Filecoin, Fleek’s integration is leveraging Filecoin’s strength as a data archiving network. Fleek periodically batches and backs up all of a user’s sites and files on Filecoin at no cost. This ensures that there is a secondary, fully decentralized backup layer to cover for the user’s IPFS storage.

### **The Space Daemon and Space SDK**

The infrastructure and set of protocols upon which Fleek is built on is made available through two interfaces, the [Space Daemon](https://fleek.co/space-daemon) and [Space SDK](https://fleek.co/space-sdk/). Developers can use these to build desktop and web applications, respectively. These two libraries offer all of the use cases Fleek provides, whether it is storage on IPFS, Filecoin backups, or interactions with Ethereum or ENS.

### **Roadmap**

Fleek’s main goal for 2022 is to restructure its IPFS infrastructure to further decentralize and incentivize it. It will also include new Web3 infrastructure providers for different pieces of the web building stack.

In upcoming releases, Fleek is doubling down on its path towards the decentralization of the entire platform, taking steps towards making the Web3 experience more tangible. This includes allowing crypto logins and payments, expanding current integrations with ENS, allowing for new Web 3.0 native sources for repositories like Radicle, and revamping the user experience.
