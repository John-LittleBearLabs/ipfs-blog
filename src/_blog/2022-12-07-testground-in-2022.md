Testground is a platform for testing and benchmarking distributed systems. We used it before to work on massive improvements to IPFS DHT, Filecoin Network, and libp2p. This year, the IPDX team re-ignited the project. We started two collaborations, created a new use case for interoperability testing, and welcomed new users and contributors.

Now that the end of the year is near; it is time for a “bragging session” and to share our master plan to take over the CIs of the entire Protocol Labs Network!

## A new use case: interoperability testing for the libp2p team

Using Testground, the libp2p team is now testing interoperability between many implementations and versions. They are now testing go-libp2p and rust-libp2p versions. js and nim testing are in the works.

**Milestones:**

- **Mixed Builders Feature**: We can now write a test that depends on [multiple builders and languages](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1367).
- **Interoperability Support Improvements in go**: Testground can [rewrite mod files](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1338), and dependencies [rewrite](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1338) have been improved. This helps users Test many different versions of a library with a single test source.
- **rust-sdk**: We introduced the [rust-sdk](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1287) and [improved it over the year](https://github.com/testground/sdk-rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
- **js-sdk**: Thanks to Little Bear Labs’ support, the Testground SDK for JavaScript [now runs in the browser](https://github.com/testground/sdk-js/pull/26).

We also [presented this project during IPFS camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2SkC4dYV-A) (Youtube).

## Massive stability improvements for supported SDKs

Testground has an issue with Flakiness. Our second focus is to improve the project's stability.

**Milestones:**

- **A refreshed Docker Runner**: to support new languages better and fix concurrency issues, we [rewrote the Docker Runner](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1407#issuecomment-1203853804). In our tests, **false negatives went from 40% to <1%.**
- **Benchmarking and stability improvements:** we've implemented tooling and [fixes](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1421) that help with CI [testing](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+merged%3A%3E%3D2022-01-01). Some of this work will soon become part of the Testground Stability Dashboard and custom CI actions.

## EKS Support

Testground is also designed to run on large Kubernetes clusters. With EKS, we hope to support large-scale tests (10k+ nodes) with low operational costs ([EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed service from AWS).

**Milestones:**

- **Preview Support for EKS:** The Bloxico Team has been working hard on [Testground EKS Support](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1350) and [Deployments](https://github.com/testground/infra/pull/78). They picked new CNI configurations and made sure the infrastructure was now deployable. This work was merged, and other teams, such as Celestia, have been building on top of it.

✨  The team also dusted off [SDKs](https://github.com/testground/sdk-js/pull/22) and [examples](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1306), helped [improve ARM support](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1372). We introduced new [features](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1481), [bug fixes](https://github.com/testground/testground/pull/1321), and [brought many more improvements](https://github.com/testground/testground/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A%3E2022-01-01+).

## New Users

New users and contributors are joining the project; They are using Testground and contributing to the project.

- **Celestia** is using Testground to [test their network](https://github.com/celestiaorg/test-infra). Building on top of our "EKS Preview", they simulate between 4 and 6 thousand nodes on a large Kubernetes Cluster.
- **Magmo** is using Testground to test and benchmark their payment channel. They had success with stability and performance measurements. They shared a (great) presentation during [Retrieval Markets Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYn8Evkrs30) (Youtube).
- **status.im** is [working](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/pull/70) on adding their nim implementation to the libp2p interoperability repository.
- **Sigma Prime** is using Testground to [test their implementation](https://github.com/ackintosh/discv5-testground) of Ethereum's Peer Discovery Protocol.
- **The number0 team** uses Testground to benchmark Iroh, an IPFS implementation written in Rust focused on efficiency. They share numbers on [their website](https://iroh.computer/).
- **The Moving the Bytes Working Group** uses Testground to benchmark and test bitswap and new protocols for data exchange. You can follow along in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/MTB-WG-Meeting-1-cfeed84309894936bd652f1b47f3221a) and join the `#move-the-bytes-wg` channel on FIL Slack.

## What's Next

We shared a [Roadmap](https://github.com/testground/testground/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) for what is coming to Testground in 2023. Here is an excerpt

- **Better Network Simulation & Many More features:** We plan on improving [network simulations](https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/1488) for libp2p and the Move The Bytes WG. We are also adding the ability to run [more complex test plans](https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/1493) and [browser support](https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/1386). Testground improves the fastest when it’s “customer-driven”.
- **Testing, Stability, and Workflows improvement:** the team [will invest](https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/1512) in bringing Testground building and testing tools to a state where it's easy & efficient to contribute. We want to improve the scale and stability of changes we can make, encourage external contributions, and communicate clearly about stability & regressions.
