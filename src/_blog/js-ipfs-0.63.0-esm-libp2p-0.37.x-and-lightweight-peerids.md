# üî¶ Highlights

> switches to ESM only, upgrades to libp2p 0.37.x and brings lightweight PeerIds

`js-IPFS@0.63.0` is rocketing forward with major improvements to its foundations along with many small bug fixes and performance improvements!

## üß± ESM

A module system lets us organise our code in way that makes sense for our application.  Without a module system, everything is one big file and/or namespace and total chaos.

[ECMAScript Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) are the module system for JavaScript.

Other modules systems have been implemented in the past (e.g., [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS), [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/)), but these have all been userland solutions to the problem of how to organize your JavaScript; none of them have ever been part of the language.

This means in order to take advantage of a module system, you need to run your code through a bundler such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) or [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), which introduces a build step and means you can't just run a js file.  We've got so used to needing the platform (e.g., node) to support a userland module system (e.g., CommonJS) or needing all this additional tooling that adds complexity and makes things slow.

The beginning of change started in 2015 with [ES6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules), which among other things introduced the module specification.

By now the `import`/`export` syntax for modules should be familiar. It's used in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [React](https://reactjs.org) and other environments, mostly via transpilation by such tools as [babel](https://babeljs.io).

Back in 2018, FireFox shipped `v60`, which meant all major browsers supported ES modules.  Node.js was the final platform that needed support.  Node.js actually released support behind a flag in `v8.5.0` in 2017 but it was only with `v13.2.0` in 2019 that it came out from behind that flag and with `v14.8.0` in 2021 that top-level ``await`` was also enabled by default.

With `v16` becoming Active LTS in October last year it meant we were [finally able](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md#supported-versions) to upgrade to ESM an embrace the bright new bundlerless future.

With `libp2p@0.37.x` and `ipfs@0.63.x` both modules are published exclusively as ESM.

There are migration guides available for [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/migrations/v0.36-v.037.md) and [ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/v0.62-v0.63.md).

If you are running in a CJS environment (e.g., node before `v14.8`), you'll need to either convert your codebase to ESM, or use the [dynamic `import` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) to load `ipfs` and/or `libp2p`.  Note that `ipfs` and `libp2p` are only tested fully on Active and Current LTS versions, which is `v16`+ at the time of writing.

## libp2p in TypeScript

With the `libp2p@0.37.x` release, `libp2p` has been entirely rewritten from the ground up in TypeScript.

This has given us a more stable and predictable base on which to build next generation distributed projects, as well as better support for automated tooling, code completion, docs and a generally greatly improved developer experience.

A large scale re-evaluation of the exposed interfaces has taken place which is a breaking change.  Please see the [libp2p@0.37.x migration guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/migrations/v0.36-v.037.md#typescript) for any changes you will need to make to your application.

## lightweight `PeerId`s

The [PeerId](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/) is a core concept of `libp2p`.  PeerIds let us identify remote peers and verify data those peers send to us, since they are either a hash of a public key in the case of an [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) derived `PeerId`, or the public key itself in the case of an [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) `PeerId`.

Prior to `libp2p@0.37.x`, the `PeerId` concept was implemented by the [peer-id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peer-id) module.  The class exported by this module was capable of all sorts of encryption-related operations, some of which required heavyweight JavaScript modules such as [node-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge) since the [web-crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) lacks certain algorithms and operations that are used by the libp2p/IPFS ecosystems.

Depending on these modules carries a significant cost for browser bundles, and the operations they are supposed to support are not used in places like `ipfs-http-client` rendering the `peer-id` module unsuitable for use in lightweight front-end applications that may only orchestrate a remote IPFS node.

This has meant that `PeerId`s are represented as strings throughout the IPFS [core-api][] which makes them very hard to reason about in parts of the API where a string could be a `PeerId`, a [multiaddr][], an [IPNS Name](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/) or something else.

With the new [@libp2p/peer-id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@libp2p/peer-id) module, this is no longer the case and implementations of the [`PeerId` interface](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-interfaces/tree/master/packages/libp2p-interfaces/src/peer-id) are essentially thin wrappers around `Uint8Array`s that contain the serialized forms of the public and/or private keys, so we can now pass them back to front-end code and have all the benefits of type safety.

The cryptographic operations and the heavy deps they require are now encapsulated within the [@libp2p/crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@libp2p/crypto) module which in general is not used by front end code.

This is also a breaking change.  Please see the [`ipfs@0.63.x` upgrade guide](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/v0.62-v0.63.md#peerids) for any changes you will need to make to your application.
